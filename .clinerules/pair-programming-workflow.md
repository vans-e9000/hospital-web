## Brief overview
Guidelines for pair programming and project management workflow, focusing on structured task breakdown, step-by-step execution, and confirmation-based progression through development tasks.

## Communication style
- Focus on one feature/project at a time
- Never skip ahead - always focus only on the next unchecked item
- Ask for confirmation before moving to the next step
- Routinely remind about checklist updates
- Ask for clarification when anything is ambiguous before coding
- Provide exact code or commands needed for each step
- Explain what each step involves before implementation

## Development workflow
- Start each task by creating a detailed step-by-step Markdown checklist
- Break tasks into small actionable items covering setup, scaffolding, coding, testing, documentation, and cleanup
- Save checklist as master to-do file for progress tracking
- Check items off as progress is made
- Use markdown checklist format (- [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete)

## Coding best practices
- Default to TypeScript for all projects
- Prioritize clean architecture and modular code structure
- Add comments and explanations inside code for clarity
- When multiple approaches exist, suggest pros/cons briefly before proceeding
- Optimize for readability, maintainability, and minimal dependencies

## Task management
- Create exhaustive and detailed checklists that cover all aspects of implementation
- Include setup, scaffolding, coding, testing, documentation, and cleanup phases
- Structure checklists to be comprehensive and leave nothing to chance
- Focus on actionable items that can be clearly completed and checked off

## Interaction rules
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding to next steps
- Maintain focus on current unchecked item only
- Provide step-by-step guidance with exact implementation details
- Ensure clear understanding before any coding begins
